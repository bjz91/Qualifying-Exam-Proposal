  abstract = {This study analyzes seasonal and temporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD), and the impact of these variations on the properties of clouds over five cities in Pakistan, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, obtained from the Terra satellite during the period (2001-2011). The obtained results indicated seasonal variation in AOD, with a high value of 23, in summer and low values of 0.2, in winter for the costal part of the region. The relationship between AOD and other cloud parameters, namely water vapor (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud liquid water path (CLWP), cloud top temperature (cm, and cloud top pressure (CUP) were analyzed. On a temporal scale, latitudinal variations of both WV and AOD produce high correlations (>0.6) in some regions, and moderate correlations (0.4-0.6) in the other regions. An increasing trend in CF with ADD was found over urban regions in the period of observations. The CF values were higher for Lahore than the other selected regions during the whole period. During autumn and winter seasons the correlation was found to be positive between AOD and CLWP, while negative correlation was observed during the other seasons for all the selected regions. COT showed negative correlation with AOD at all locations except Karachi during spring and summer seasons.
AOD showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT for the spring season and a negative correlation was observed for summer for all investigated regions. Furthermore, in warm clouds AOD and CUP were negatively correlated for all regions except Peshawar, whereas, AOD and CTT were positively correlated for all regions except Karachi. In cold clouds the relationships between AOD and CUP, and AOD and CTT were negative, except Karachi. Thus meteorological parameters, geographical conditions, as well as warm and cold clouds are the causative factors for AOD and CUP, and AOD and CTT variations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical properties have been extensively used to estimate ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in support of air pollution health effects research and air quality assessment at the urban to global scales. However, a large proportion, similar to 70%, of satellite observations of aerosols are missing as a result of cloud-cover, surface brightness, and snow-cover. The resulting PM2.5 estimates could therefore be biased due to this non-random data missingness. Cloud-cover in particular has the potential to impact ground-level PM2.5 concentrations through complex chemical and physical processes. We developed a series of statistical models using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product at 1 km resolution with information from the MODIS cloud product and meteorological information to investigate the extent to which cloud parameters and associated meteorological conditions impact ground-level aerosols at two urban sites in the US: Atlanta and San Francisco. We find that changes in temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, convective available potential energy, precipitation, cloud effective radius, cloud optical depth, and cloud emissivity are associated with changes in PM2.5 concentration and composition, and the changes differ by overpass time and cloud phase as well as between the San Francisco and Atlanta sites. A case-study at the San Francisco site confirmed that accounting for cloud-cover and associated meteorological conditions could substantially alter the spatial distribution of monthly ground-level PM2.5 concentrations.},

We linked the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs databases to build an observational cohort of 2,482,737 United States veterans, and used survival models to evaluate the association of PM2.5 concentrations and risk of incident eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), incident CKD, eGFR decline >/=30%, and ESRD over a median follow-up of 8.52 years. County-level exposure was defined at baseline as the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2004, and separately as time-varying where it was updated annually and as cohort participants moved. In analyses of baseline exposure (median, 11.8 [interquartile range, 10.1-13.7] microg/m(3)), a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with increased risk of eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14 to 1.29), CKD (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.38), eGFR decline >/=30% (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.39), and ESRD (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.35). In time-varying analyses, a 10-microg/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with similarly increased risk of eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), CKD, eGFR decline >/=30%, and ESRD. Spline analyses showed a linear relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and risk of kidney outcomes. Exposure estimates derived from National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite data yielded consistent results.

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating the burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in ambient air requires knowledge of both the shape and magnitude of the relative risk (RR) function. However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places in the world is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children < 5 years of age. METHODS: We fit an integrated exposure-response (IER) model by integrating available RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke, household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted to estimated annual PM2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient PM2.5 concentrations. RESULTS: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, < 1 to 21 for COPD, < 1 to 25 for LC, and < 1 to 38 for ALRI. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a fine particulate mass-based RR model that covered the global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types that generate emissions of particulate matter. The model can be updated as new RR information becomes available.},

Continuous PM2.5 mass and time-integrated chemical speciation data were acquired from a central valley monitoring site, along with meteorological measurements from nearby sites. All nine days with PM2.5 > 35 mu g m(-3) showed 24-h average temperature inversion of 1.5-4.5 degrees C and snow cover of 8-18 cm. Stagnant atmospheric conditions limited wind ventilation while highly reflective snow cover reduced daytime surface heating creating persistent inversion. Elevated ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and water associated with it are found to be main reasons for the PM2.5 exceedances. An effective-variance chemical mass balance (EV-CMB) receptor model using locally-derived geological profiles and inorganic/organic markers confirmed secondary NH4NO3 (27-37 %), residential wood combustion (RWC; 11-51 %), and diesel engine exhaust (7-22 %) as the dominant PM2.5 contributors. Paved road dust and de-icing materials were minor, but detectable contributors. RWC is a more important source than diesel for organic carbon (OC), but vice versa for elemental carbon (EC). A majority of secondary NH4NO3 is also attributed to RWC and diesel engines (including snow removal equipment) through oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from these sources. Findings from this study may apply to similar situations experienced by other urban valleys.},

The extensive validation made during July - September 2000 encompasses 315 co-located tau(a) in space and time derived by MODIS and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) from more than 30 AERONET sites. The lack of AERONET measurements in East Asia, India and Australia makes this validation unavailable for those regions. The MODIS aerosol retrievals, except in coastal zones, are found within the retrieval errors of Deltatau(a) = +/-0.05 +/-0.2 tau(a). The root mean square (RMS) errors are less than or equal to0.1 in the continental inland regions and up to 0.3 in the coastal regions (attributed mainly to water contaminated signals). With this validation we believe that MODIS aerosol products can be used quantitatively in many applications with caution for possible residual clouds, snow/ice, and water contamination.},

  abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides daily global coverage, but the 10 km resolution of its aerosol optical depth (AOD) product is not suitable for studying spatial variability of aerosols in urban areas. Recently, a new Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm was developed for MODIS which provides AOD at 1 km resolution. Using MAIAC data, the relationship between MAIAC AOD and PM2.5 as measured by the 27 EPA ground monitoring stations was investigated. These results were also compared to conventional MODIS 10 km AOD retrievals (MOD04) for the same days and locations. The coefficients of determination for MOD04 and for MAIAC are R-2 =0.45 and 0.50 respectively, suggested that AOD is a reasonably good proxy for PM2.5 ground concentrations. Finally, we studied the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD at the intra-urban scale (a (c) 1/210 km) in Boston. The fine resolution results indicated spatial variability in particle concentration at a sub-10 kilometer scale. A local analysis for the Boston area showed that the AOD-PM2.5 relationship does not depend on relative humidity and air temperatures below similar to 7 A degrees C. The correlation improves for temperatures above 7-16 A degrees C. We found no dependence on the boundary layer height except when the former was in the range 250-500 m. Finally, we apply a mixed effects model approach to MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from MODIS to predict PM2.5 concentrations within the greater Boston area. With this approach we can control for the inherent day-to-day variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, which depends on time-varying parameters such as particle optical properties, vertical and diurnal concentration profiles and ground surface reflectance. Our results show that the model-predicted PM2.5 mass concentrations are highly correlated with the actual observations (out-of-sample R-2 of 0.86). Therefore, adjustment for the daily variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship provides a means for obtaining spatially-resolved PM2.5 concentrations.},

In addition, its spatial resolution is usually too coarse to characterize the spatial pattern in pollutant concentrations in urban environments. Our objective was to calibrate daily GEOS-Chem simulations using ground monitoring data and incorporating meteorological variables, land use terms and spatial-temporal lagged terms. Major PM2.5 components of our interest include sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon, elemental carbon, ammonium, sea salt and dust. We used a backward propagation neural network to calibrate GEOS-Chem predictions with a spatial resolution of 0.500 degrees x 0.667 degrees using monitoring data collected during the period from 2001 to 2010 for the Northeastern United States. Subsequently, we made predictions at 1 km x 1 km grid cells. We determined the accuracy of the spatial temporal predictions using ten-fold cross-validation and "leave-one-day-out" cross-validation techniques. We found a high total R-2 for PM2.5 mass (all data R-2 0.85, yearly values: 0.80-0.88) and PM2.5 components (R-2 for individual components were around 0.70-0.80). Our model makes it possible to assess spatially- and temporally-resolved short- and long-term exposures to PM2.5 mass and components for epidemiological studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Aerosol spatial distribution in populated mountain areas is very heterogeneous and often characterized by scales of variability of several kilometers. Satellites provide an effective tool to map aerosols on an operational basis, but most of the aerosol products intended for continental/global applications have a coarse spatial resolution (10-18 km). The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a recently developed algorithm for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provides Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at a high resolution of 1 km. We analyze the quality and potential of MAIAC AOD in the Alpine region and we derive high resolution AOD maps for the years 2008 and 2009. Cloudiness and snow in mountain regions occasionally lead to an overestimation of AOD due to unresolved cloud and snow pixel contamination. Therefore, we developed a filter that almost preserves the spatial resolution of the product to ensure the good accuracy of MAIAC AOD for air-quality and climatological applications. The AOD is validated with AERONET measurements in the region and compared to the standard MODIS AOD product (MOD04). Similar accuracies are found for both products (RMSE = 0.05) but with MAIAC providing about 50% more observations at the examined locations, because of its higher spatial resolution and less restrictive filtering. Comparison with ground measurements of aerosol mass (PM10) shows that MAIAC AOD can be used to detect the fine scales of aerosol variability (2-3 km) in the mountains. Finally, AOD maps for the Alpine region demonstrate that topography is correlated with the average aerosol spatial distribution.},

An assessment of the integrated use of ground-based and satellite data for air quality monitoring, including several short case studies, was conducted. Findings identified current U.S. satellites with potential for air quality applications, with others available internationally and several more to be launched within the next 5 yr; several of these sensors are described in this paper as illustrations. However, use of these data for air quality applications has been hindered by historical lack of collaboration between air quality and satellite scientists, difficulty accessing and understanding new data, limited resources and agency priorities to develop new techniques, ill-defined needs, and poor understanding of the potential and limitations of the data. Specialization in organizations and funding sources has limited the resources for cross-disciplinary projects. To successfully use these new data sets requires increased collaboration between organizations, streamlined access to data, and resources for project implementation.},

Three methods are developed for fusing ambient monitor measurements and 12 km resolution chemical transport model (CMAQ) simulations to estimate daily air pollutant concentrations across Georgia. Temporal variance is determined by observations in one method, with the annual mean CMAQ field providing spatial structure. A second method involves scaling daily CMAQ simulated fields using mean observations to reduce bias. Finally, a weighted average of these results based on prediction of temporal variance provides optimized daily estimates for each 12 x 12 km grid. These methods were applied to daily metrics of 12 pollutants (CO, NO2, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and five PM2.5 components) over the state of Georgia for a seven-year period (2002-2008). Cross-validation demonstrates a wide range in optimized model performance across pollutants, with SO2 predicted most poorly due to limitations in coal combustion plume monitoring and modeling. For the other pollutants studied, 54-88% of the spatiotemporal variance (Pearson R(2) from cross-validation) was captured, with ozone and PM2.5 predicted best. The optimized fusion approach developed provides daily spatial field estimates of air pollutant concentrations and uncertainties that are consistent with observations, emissions, and meteorology.},

  abstract = {Persistent winter inversions result in poor air quality in the Intermountain West of the United States. Although the onset of an inversion is relatively easy to predict, the duration and the subsequent breakup of a persistent inversion event remains a forecasting challenge. For this reason and for this region, historic soundings were analyzed for Salt Lake City, Utah, with reanalysis and station data to investigate how persistent inversion events are modulated by synoptic and intraseasonal variabilities. The results point to a close linkage between persistent inversions and the dominant intraseasonal (30 day) mode that characterizes the winter circulation regime over the Pacific Northwest. Meteorological variables and pollution (e. g., particulate matter of <= 2.5-mu m diameter, PM2.5) revealed coherent variations with this intraseasonal mode. The intraseasonal mode also modulates the characteristics of the synoptic (6 day) variability and further influences the duration of persistent inversions in the Intermountain West. The interaction between modes suggests that a complete forecast of persistent inversions is more involved and technically beyond numerical weather prediction models intended for the medium range (similar to 10 day). Therefore, to predict persistent inversions, the results point to the adoption of standard medium-range forecasts with a longer-term climate diagnostic approach.},

  abstract = {Many populated valleys in the western United States experience increased concentrations of particulate matter with diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) during winter stagnation conditions. Further study into the chemical components composing wintertime PM2.5 and how the composition and level of wintertime PM2.5 are related to meteorological conditions can lead to a better understanding of the causes of high PM2.5 and aid in development and application of emission controls. The results can also aid in short-term air-pollution forecasting and implementation of periodic emission controls such as burning bans. This study examines relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and wintertime atmospheric stability (defined by heat deficit) during snow-covered and snow-free conditions from 2000 to 2013 for five western U.S. urbanizations: Salt Lake City, Utah; Reno, Nevada; Boise, Idaho; Missoula, Montana; and Spokane, Washington. Radiosonde data were used where available to calculate daily heat deficit, which was compared with PM2.5 concentration for days with snow cover and days with no snow cover. Chemically speciated PM2.5 data were compared for snow-cover and snow-free days to see whether the chemical abundances varied by day category. Wintertime PM2.5 levels were highly correlated with heat deficit for all cities except Spokane, where the airport sounding does not represent the urban valley. For a given static stability, snow-cover days experienced higher PM2.5 levels than did snow-free days, mainly because of enhanced ammonium nitrate concentrations. Normalizing average PM2.5 to the heat deficit reduced year-to-year PM2.5 variability, resulting in stronger downward trends, mostly because of reduced carbonaceous aerosol concentrations. The study was limited to western U.S. cities, but similar results are expected for other urban areas in mountainous terrain with cold, snowy winters.},

However, satellites are sensitive to the entire aerosol column, not only the aerosol near the surface that impacts human health. In part 1 of this series, we used multiple regression to demonstrate how inclusion of meteorological analyses can help constrain the surface level proportion of the aerosol profile and improve the estimate of surface PM2.5. Here, instead of multiple regression technique, we describe an artificial neural network (ANN) framework that reduces the uncertainty of surface PM estimation from satellite data. We use 3 years of MODIS aerosol optical thickness data at 0.55 mu m and meteorological analyses from the rapid update cycle to estimate surface level PM2.5 over the southeast United States (EPA region 4). As compared to regression coefficients obtained through simple correlation (R = 0.60) or multiple regression (R = 0.68) techniques, the ANN derives hourly PM2.5 data that compare with observations with R = 0.74. For estimating daily mean PM2.5, the ANN techniques results in correlation of R = 0.78. Although the degree of improvement varies over different sites and seasons, this study demonstrates the potential for using ANN for operational air quality monitoring.},

METHODS: The study investigated county-level, age-adjusted mortality rates for the years 2000-2004 for heart, respiratory and kidney disease in relation to tons of coal mined. Four groups of counties were compared: Appalachian counties with more than 4 million tons of coal mined from 2000 to 2004; Appalachian counties with mining at less than 4 million tons, non-Appalachian counties with coal mining, and other non-coal mining counties across the nation. Forms of chronic illness were contrasted with acute illness. Poisson regression models were analyzed separately for male and female mortality rates. Covariates included percent male population, college and high school education rates, poverty rates, race/ethnicity rates, primary care physician supply, rural-urban status, smoking rates and a Southern regional variable. RESULTS: For both males and females, mortality rates in Appalachian counties with the highest level of coal mining were significantly higher relative to non-mining areas for chronic heart, respiratory and kidney disease, but were not higher for acute forms of illness. Higher rates of acute heart and respiratory mortality were found for non-Appalachian coal mining counties. CONCLUSIONS: Higher chronic heart, respiratory and kidney disease mortality in coal mining areas may partially reflect environmental exposure to particulate matter or toxic agents present in coal and released in its mining and processing. Differences between Appalachian and non-Appalachian areas may reflect different mining practices, population demographics, or mortality coding variability.},

Random forests are an ensemble learning method that provides predictions with high accuracy and interpretability. Our results achieve an overall cross-validation (CV) R-2 value of 0.80. Mean prediction error (MPE) and root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) for daily predictions are 1.78 and 2.83 mu g/m(3), respectively, indicating a good agreement between CV predictions and observations. The prediction accuracy of our model is similar to those reported in previous studies using neural networks or regression models on both national and regional scales. In addition, the incorporation of convolutional layers for land use terms and nearby PM2.5 measurements increase CV R2 by 0.02 and,-0.06, respectively, indicating their significant contributions to prediction accuracy. A pair of different variable importance measures both indicate that the convolutional layer for nearby PM2.5 measurements and AOD values are among the most important predictor variables for the training process.},

In this paper, a geographically weighted regression model was developed to examine the relationship among PM2.5, aerosol optical depth, meteorological parameters, and land use information. Additionally, two meteorological datasets, North American Regional Reanalysis and North American Land Data Assimilation System, were fitted into the model separately to compare their performances. The study area is centered at the Atlanta Metro area, and data were collected from various sources for the year 2003. The results showed that the mean local R-2 of the models using North American Regional Reanalysis was 0.60 and those using North American Land Data Assimilation System reached 0.61. The root mean squared prediction error showed that the prediction accuracy was 82.7% and 83.0% for North American Regional Reanalysis and North American Land Data Assimilation System in model fitting, respectively, and 69.7% and 72.1% in cross validation. The results indicated that geographically weighted regression combined with aerosol optical depth, meteorological parameters, and land use information as the predictor variables could generate a better fit and achieve high accuracy in PM2.5 exposure estimation, and North American Land Data Assimilation System could be used as an alternative of North American Regional Reanalysis to provide some of the meteorological fields.

Ground in situ measurements of PM2.5 concentrations are considered to be the gold standard, but are time-consuming and costly. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have the potential to supplement the ground monitoring networks to provide spatiotemporally-resolved PM2.5 exposure estimates. However, the coarse resolutions (e.g., 10 km) of the satellite AOD products used in previous studies make it very difficult to estimate urban-scale PM2.5 characteristics that are crucial to population-based PM2.5 health effects research. In this paper, a new aerosol product with 1 km spatial resolution derived by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm was examined using a two-stage spatial statistical model with meteorological fields (e.g., wind speed) and land use parameters (e.g., forest cover, road length, elevation, and point emissions) as ancillary variables to estimate daily mean PM2.5 concentrations. The study area is the southeastern U.S., and data for 2003 were collected from various sources. A cross validation approach was implemented for model validation. We obtained R-2 of 0.83, mean prediction error (MPE) of 1.89 mu g/m(3), and square root of the mean squared prediction errors (RMSPE) of 2.73 mu g/m(3) in model fitting, and R-2 of 0.67, MPE of 2.54 mu g/m(3), and RMSPE of 3.88 mu g/m(3) in cross validation. Both model fitting and cross validation indicate a good fit between the dependent variable and predictor variables.

  volume   = {8},
  abstract = {Background: Numerous studies have found adverse health effects of acute and chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Air pollution epidemiological studies relying on ground measurements provided by monitoring networks are often limited by sparse and unbalanced spatial distribution of the monitors. Studies have found correlations between satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and PM2.5 in some land regions. Satellite aerosol data may be used to extend the spatial coverage of PM2.5 exposure assessment. This study was to investigate correlation between PM2.5 and AOD in the conterminous USA, to derive a spatially complete PM2.5 surface by merging satellite AOD data and ground measurements based on the potential correlation, and to examine if there is an association of coronary heart disease with PM2.5.
Results: Years 2003 and 2004 daily MODIS ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) Level 2 AOD images were collated with US EPA PM2.5 data covering the conterminous USA. Pearson's correlation analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) found that the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD is not spatially consistent across the conterminous states. The average correlation is 0.67 in the east and 0.22 in the west. GWR predicts well in the east and poorly in the west. The GWR model was used to derive a PM2.5 grid surface using the mean AOD raster calculated using the daily AOD data (RMSE = 1.67 mu g/m(3)). Fitting of a Bayesian hierarchical model linking PM2.5 with age-race standardized mortality rates (SMRs) of chronic coronary heart disease found that areas with higher values of PM2.5 also show high rates of CCHD mortality: beta(PM2.5) = 0.802, posterior 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI) = (0.386, 1.225).
Conclusion: There is a spatial variation of the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD in the conterminous USA. In the eastern USA where AOD correlates well with PM2.5, AOD can be merged with ground PM2.5 data to derive a PM2.5 surface for epidemiological study. The study found that chronic coronary heart disease mortality rate increases with exposure to PM2.5.},

The data have been analyzed for the period of 10-years between March 2003 and February 2013 over 12 major cities in China. The results revealed that high AOD noticed over low latitude regions influenced with high anthropogenic activities and the low AOD observed for the high altitude and mountainous areas, since AOD accounts for the slant path which reduces the aerosol emissions. In addition, the aerosol variations in the atmosphere are complicated by several factors in emissions (natural and anthropogenic) as well as stagnant synoptic meteorology. From the temporal studies, it is clear that the maximum AOD was found during summer followed by spring and autumn with a minimum AOD in winter season for all the regions of study in China. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between AOD versus water vapor (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER), cloud top pressure (CTP), and cloud top temperature (CTT) for the selected regions in China. Additionally, regression analysis and one paired student's t-Test were applied to represent the probability of data significant at 95% confidence for the derived AOD values and cloud parameters in order to provide a better understanding of aerosol-cloud interaction.},

  abstract = {The use of satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) to estimate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for epidemiology studies has increased substantially over the past few years. These recent studies often report moderate predictive power, which can generate downward bias in effect estimates. In addition, AOD measurements have only moderate spatial resolution, and have substantial missing data. We make use of recent advances in MODIS satellite data processing algorithms (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), which allow us to use 1 km (versus currently available 10 km) resolution AOD data. We developed and cross validated models to predict daily PM2.5 at a 1 x 1 km resolution across the northeastern USA (New England, New York and New Jersey) for the years 2003-2011, allowing us to better differentiate daily and long term exposure between urban, suburban, and rural areas. Additionally, we developed an approach that allows us to generate daily high-resolution 200 m localized predictions representing deviations from the area 1 x 1 km grid predictions. We used mixed models regressing PM2.5 measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random AOD and temperature slopes. We then use generalized additive mixed models with spatial smoothing to generate grid cell predictions when AOD was missing. Finally, to get 200 m localized predictions, we regressed the residuals from the final model for each monitor against the local spatial and temporal variables at each monitoring site. Our model performance was excellent (mean out-of-sample R-2 = 0.88). The spatial and temporal components of the out-of-sample results also presented very good fits to the withheld data (R2 = 0.87, R-2 = 0.87). In addition, our results revealed very little bias in the predicted concentrations (Slope of predictions versus withheld observations = 0.99). Our daily model results show high predictive accuracy at high spatial resolutions and will be useful in reconstructing exposure histories for epidemiological studies across this region.

Satellite-derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measurements have the potential to provide spatio-temporally resolved predictions of both long and short term exposures, but previous studies have generally showed relatively low predictive power. Our objective was to extend our previous work on day-specific calibrations of AOD data using ground PM2.5 measurements by incorporating commonly used LUR variables and meteorological variables, thus benefiting from both the spatial resolution from the LUR models and the spatio-temporal resolution from the satellite models. Later we use spatial smoothing to predict PM2.5 concentrations for day/locations with missing AOD measures. We used mixed models with random slopes for day to calibrate AOD data for 2000-2008 across New-England with monitored PM2.5 measurements. We then used a generalized additive mixed model with spatial smoothing to estimate PM2.5 in location day pairs with missing AOD, using regional measured PM2.5, AOD values in neighboring cells, and land use. Finally, local (100 m) land use terms were used to model the difference between grid cell prediction and monitored value to capture very local traffic particles. Out-of-sample ten-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions. For days with available AOD data we found high out-of-sample R-2 (mean out-of-sample R-2 = 0.830, year to year variation 0.725-0.904). For days without AOD values, our model performance was also excellent (mean out-of-sample R-2 = 0.810, year to year variation 0.692-0.887). Importantly, these R-2 are for daily, rather than monthly or yearly, values. Our model allows one to assess short term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and chronic effects of ambient particles, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements have the potential to provide spatiotemporally resolved predictions of both long and short-term exposures, but previous studies have generally shown moderate predictive power and lacked detailed high spatio- temporal resolution predictions across large domains. We aimed at extending our previous work by validating our model in another region with different geographical and metrological characteristics, and incorporating fine scale land use regression and nonrandom missingness to better predict PM2.5 concentrations for days with or without satellite AOD measures. We start by calibrating AOD data for 2000-2008 across the Mid-Atlantic. We used mixed models regressing PM2.5 measurements against day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random AOD and temperature slopes. We used inverse probability weighting to account for nonrandom missingness of AOD, nested regions within days to capture spatial variation in the daily calibration, and introduced a penalization method that reduces the dimensionality of the large number of spatial and temporal predictors without selecting different predictors in different locations. We then take advantage of the association between grid-cell specific AOD values and PM2.5 monitoring data, together with associations between AOD values in neighboring grid cells to develop grid cell predictions when AOD is missing. Finally to get local predictions (at the resolution of 50 m), we regressed the residuals from the predictions for each monitor from these previous steps against the local land use variables specific for each monitor. "Out-of-sample" 10-fold cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of our predictions at each step. For all days without AOD values, model performance was excellent (mean "out-of-sample" R-2 = 0.81, year-to-year variation 0.79-0.84). Upon removal of outliers in the PM2.5 monitoring data, the results of the cross validation procedure was even better (overall mean "out of sample" R-2 of 0.85). Further, cross validation results revealed no bias in the predicted concentrations (Slope of observed vs predicted = 0.97-1.01). Our model allows one to reliably assess short-term and long-term human exposures in order to investigate both the acute and effects of ambient particles, respectively.},

  abstract = {To mitigate the harmful effect of particulates on human health, EU wide limit values for concentrations have been set. However, particulate matter (PM) measurements suffer from substantial uncertainty because PM is difficult to measure on a routine basis, which is necessary for monitoring compliance. Moreover, different measurement and calibration methods are used in the many air-quality networks in Europe. Consequently, the understanding of PM levels over Europe as a whole is rather limited. We aim to improve this situation by making use of additional information from satellite observations. As a first step, we present here a comparison for Europe of spatio-temporal variations of PM with those of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measured by the MODIS satellite instrument, for 2003. The MODIS measurements clearly show the major aerosol source regions in Northern Italy, Southern Poland, and the Belgium/Netherlands/Ruhr area, as well as individual large cities and industrialised valleys (Rhone, Danube). The spatial correlation between yearly average PM10 and AOT is 0.6 for rural background stations.
The seasonal variation of AOT and PM is distinctly different, however. Throughout most of Europe, the ACT as measured by MODIS has a clear minimum in the winter months. The seasonal variation in PM differs across Europe, and at many locations the seasonal variation is less marked than that of the AOT. Consequently, the correlation between one-year time-series of AOT with PM10/PM2.5 is low (0.3). The correlation between PM and AOT is improved when the AOT is divided by the boundary layer height and, to a lesser extent, when it is corrected for growth of aerosols with relative humidity. In that case, the average correlation is 0.5 (PM10) and 0.6 (PM2.5), averaged over rural and (sub) urban background stations. These results indicate that AOT measurements can be useful to improve the monitoring of PM distributions over Europe. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies investigating the human health effects of PM2.5 are susceptible to exposure measurement errors, a form of bias in exposure estimates, since they rely on data from a limited number of PM2.5 monitors within their study area. Satellite data can be used to expand spatial coverage, potentially enhancing our ability to estimate location-or subject-specific exposures to PM2.5, but some have reported poor predictive power. A new methodology was developed to calibrate aerosol optical depth (AOD) data obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Subsequently, this method was used to predict ground daily PM2.5 concentrations in the New England region. 2003 MODIS AOD data corresponding to the New England region were retrieved, and PM2.5 concentrations measured at 26 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM2.5 monitoring sites were used to calibrate the AOD data. A mixed effects model which allows day-today variability in daily PM(2.)5-AOD relationships was used to predict location-specific PM2.5 levels. PM2.5 concentrations measured at the monitoring sites were compared to those predicted for the corresponding grid cells. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons between the observed and predicted concentrations suggested that the proposed new calibration approach renders MODIS AOD data a potentially useful predictor of PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, the estimated PM2.5 levels within the study domain were examined in relation to air pollution sources. Our approach made it possible to investigate the spatial patterns of PM2.5 concentrations within the study domain.},

Here, we introduce the Collection 6 (C6) algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol size parameters from MODIS-observed spectral reflectance. While not a major overhaul from the previous Collection 5 (C5) version, there are enough changes that there are significant impacts to the products and their interpretation. The C6 aerosol data set will be created from three separate retrieval algorithms that operate over different surface types. These are the two "Dark Target"(DT) algorithms for retrieving (1) over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths) and (2) over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible), plus the "Deep Blue"(DB) algorithm developed originally for retrieving (3) over desert/arid land (bright in the visible). Here, we focus on DT-ocean and DT-land (# 1 and # 2). We have updated assumptions for central wavelengths, Rayleigh optical depths and gas (H2O, O-3, CO2, etc.) absorption corrections, while relaxing the solar zenith angle limit (up to <= 84 degrees) to increase poleward coverage. For DT-land, we have updated the cloud mask to allow heavy smoke retrievals, fine-tuned the assignments for aerosol type as function of season/location, corrected bugs in the Quality Assurance (QA) logic, and added diagnostic parameters such topographic altitude. For DT-ocean, improvements include a revised cloud mask for thin-cirrus detection, inclusion of wind speed dependence on the surface reflectance, updates to logic of QA Confidence flag (QAC) assignment, and additions of important diagnostic information. At the same time, we quantified how "upstream"changes to instrument calibration, land/sea masking and cloud masking will also impact the statistics of global AOD, and affect Terra and Aqua differently. For Aqua, all changes will result in reduced global AOD (by 0.02) over ocean and increased AOD (by 0.02) over land, along with changes in spatial coverage. We compared preliminary data to surface-based sun photometer data, and show that C6 should improve upon C5. C6 will include a merged DT/DB product over semi-arid land surfaces for reduced-gap coverage and better visualization, and new information about clouds in the aerosol field. Responding to the needs of the air quality community, in addition to the standard 10 km product, C6 will include a global (DT-land and DT-ocean) aerosol product at 3 km resolution.},

NASA/MODIS Dense Dark Vegetation (DDV) algorithm has been proven valuable in deriving aerosol distribution and properties over land; however, it cannot be applied to bright targets. As a supplement to the DDV algorithm, an algorithm to retrieve AOD over urban areas in North China in winter is developed using MODIS data, including (1) the generation and analysis of adjacent clear-days surface reflectance using MOD09 product from 2007 to 2008, and (2) seasonal aerosol models derived from AERONET data in Beijing and Xianghe sites. Ground-based measurements using sun photometers were used to validate the retrieved AOD, and the correlation coefficient (r) is up to 0.931. Especially for high AOD values (AOD > 0.4), more retrievals meet the inversion accuracy. The temporal variations of retrieval errors over urban, rural and mountain regions were examined, and the results indicated that the variation of blue-band surface reflectance is less than 0.02 in a short period except for unusual weather conditions, the retrieval bias is under 0.08, and the relative error decreases as the AOD increases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. METHODS: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. FINDINGS: In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7.0% [95% uncertainty interval 6.2-7.7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6.3% [5.5-7.0]), and alcohol use (5.5% [5.0-5.9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7.9% [6.8-9.4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 7.0% [5.6-8.3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6.1% [5.4-6.8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10.0% (95% UI 9.2-10.8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0.9% (0.4-1.6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

The models included meteorological parameters obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Rapid Update Cycle (RUC20) model as covariates. Both MISR and MODIS AOT values were highly significant predictors Of PM2.5 concentrations. The MISR and MODIS models have overall comparable predictability of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The MISR model explained a slightly greater percentage (62%) of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations than the MODIS model (51%), and thus was a better fit. Over the entire data range, the MISR model underpredicts PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 12%, whereas the MODIS model underpredicts PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 18%. This underestimation occurred primarily at higher PM2.5 concentrations in both models. The regression coefficients from two models were highly comparable, suggesting that combining MISR and MODIS AOT data might benefit from the higher predicting accuracy of MISR and the better spatial coverage of MODIS. The newly developed particle size/shape indicators in MISR and MODIS aerosol product did not significantly improve our ability to predict PM2.5 concentrations using AOT measurements. Finally, using hourly PM2.5 concentrations did not seem to improve its association with AOT for the current study region. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVES: In this study we examined the benefits of using aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) in conjunction with land use and meteorologic information to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations.
METHODS: We developed a two-stage generalized additive model (GAM) for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency PM2.5 concentrations in a domain centered in Massachusetts. The AOD model represents conditions when AOD retrieval is successful; the non-AOD model represents conditions when AOD is missing in the domain.
RESULTS: The AOD model has a higher predicting power judged by adjusted R-2 (0.79) than does the non-AOD model (0.48). The predicted PM2.5 concentrations by the AOD model are, on average, 0.8-0.9 mu g/m(3) higher than the non-AOD model predictions, with a more smooth spatial distribution, higher concentrations in rural areas, and the highest concentrations in areas other than major urban centers. Although AOD is a highly significant predictor Of PM2.5, meteorologic parameters are major contributors to the better performance of the AOD model.
CONCLUSIONS: GOES aerosol/smoke product (GASP) AOD is able to summarize a set of weather and land use conditions that stratify PM2.5 concentrations into two different spatial patterns. Even if land use regression models do not include AOD as a predictor variable, two separate models should be fitted to account for different PM2.5 spatial patterns related to AOD availability.},

Overall, the empirical model explained 48% of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations. The root-mean-square error of the model was 6.2 mu g/m(3) with a corresponding average PM2.5 concentration of 13.8 mu g/m(3). When PM2.5 concentrations greater than 40 mu g/m(3) were removed, model results were shown to be unbiased estimators of observations. Several factors, such as planetary boundary layer height, relative humidity, season, and other geographical attributes of monitoring sites, were found to influence the association between PM2.5 and AOT. The findings of this study illustrate the strong potential of satellite remote sensing in regional ambient air quality monitoring as an extension to ground networks. With the continual advancement of remote sensing technology and global data assimilation systems, AOT measurements derived from satellite remote sensors may provide a cost-effective approach as a supplemental source of information for determining ground-level particle concentrations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Living near major roadways has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, but little is known about its impact on renal function. METHODS: We calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for 1103 consecutive Boston-area patients hospitalised with confirmed acute ischaemic stroke between 1999 and 2004. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between eGFR and categories of residential distance to major roadway (0 to </=50, >50 to </=100, >100 to </=200, >200 to </=400, >400 to </=1000 and >1000 m) adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking, comorbid conditions, treatment with ACE inhibitor and neighbourhood-level socioeconomic characteristics. In a second analysis, we considered the log of distance to major roadway as a continuous variable. RESULTS: Patients living closer to a major roadway had lower eGFR than patients living farther away (Ptrend=0.01). Comparing patients living 50 m versus 1000 m from a major roadway was associated with a 3.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR (95% CI 1.0 to 6.7; p=0.007): a difference comparable in magnitude to the reduction in eGFR observed for a 4-year increase in age in population-based studies. The magnitude of this association did not differ significantly across categories of age, sex, race, history of hypertension, diabetes or socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Living near a major roadway is associated with lower eGFR in a cohort of patients presenting with acute ischaemic stroke. If causal, these results imply that exposures associated with living near a major roadway contribute to reduced renal function, an important risk factor for cardiovascular events.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a radiative transfer basis of the algorithm MAIAC which performs simultaneous retrievals of atmospheric aerosol and bidirectional surface reflectance from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The retrievals are based on an accurate semianalytical solution for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance expressed as an explicit function of three parameters of the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse model of surface bidirectional reflectance. This solution depends on certain functions of atmospheric properties and geometry which are precomputed in the look-up table (LUT). This paper further considers correction of the LUT functions for variations of surface pressure/height and of atmospheric water vapor, which is a common task in the operational remote sensing. It introduces a new analytical method for the water vapor correction of the multiple-scattering path radiance. It also summarizes the few basic principles that provide a high efficiency and accuracy of the LUT-based radiative transfer for the aerosol/surface retrievals and optimize the size of LUT. For example, the single-scattering path radiance is calculated analytically for a given surface pressure and atmospheric water vapor. The same is true for the direct surface-reflected radiance, which along with the single-scattering path radiance largely defines the angular dependence of measurements. For these calculations, the aerosol phase functions and kernels of the surface bidirectional reflectance model are precalculated at a high angular resolution. The other radiative transfer functions depend rather smoothly on angles because of multiple scattering and can be calculated at coarser angular resolution to reduce the LUT size. At the same time, this resolution should be high enough to use the nearest neighbor geometry angles to avoid costly three-dimensional interpolation. The pressure correction is implemented via linear interpolation between two LUTs computed for the standard and reduced pressure levels. A linear mixture and a modified linear mixture methods are used to represent different aerosol types in the aerosol/surface retrievals from several base models of the fine and coarse aerosol fractions. In summary, the developed LUT algorithm allows fast high-accuracy simulations of the outgoing radiance with full variability of the atmospheric and surface bidirectional reflectance properties for the aerosol/surface remote sensing.},

  abstract = {An aerosol component of a new multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm is presented. MAIAC is a generic algorithm developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which performs aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction over both dark vegetated surfaces and bright deserts based on a time series analysis and image-based processing. The MAIAC look-up tables explicitly include surface bidirectional reflectance. The aerosol algorithm derives the spectral regression coefficient (SRC) relating surface bidirectional reflectance in the blue (0.47 mu m) and shortwave infrared (2.1 mu m) bands; this quantity is prescribed in the MODIS operational Dark Target algorithm based on a parameterized formula. The MAIAC aerosol products include aerosol optical thickness and a fine-mode fraction at resolution of 1 km. This high resolution, required in many applications such as air quality, brings new information about aerosol sources and, potentially, their strength. AERONET validation shows that the MAIAC and MOD04 algorithms have similar accuracy over dark and vegetated surfaces and that MAIAC generally improves accuracy over brighter surfaces due to the SRC retrieval and explicit bidirectional reflectance factor characterization, as demonstrated for several U. S. West Coast AERONET sites. Due to its generic nature and developed angular correction, MAIAC performs aerosol retrievals over bright deserts, as demonstrated for the Solar Village Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Saudi Arabia.},

MAIAC uses a time series and spatial analysis for cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction. It implements a moving window of up to 16 days of MODIS data gridded to 1 km resolution in a selected projection. The RTLS parameters are computed directly by fitting the cloud-free MODIS top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data stored in the processing queue. The RTLS retrieval is applied when the land surface is stable or changes slowly. In case of rapid or large magnitude change (as for instance caused by disturbance), MAIAC follows the MODIS operational BRDF/albedo algorithm and uses a scaling approach where the BRDF shape is assumed stable but its magnitude is adjusted based on the latest single measurement. To assess the stability of the surface, MAIAC features a change detection algorithm which analyzes relative change of reflectance in the Red and NIR bands during the accumulation period. To adjust for the reflectance variability with the sun-observer geometry and allow comparison among different days (view geometries), the BRFs are normalized to the fixed view geometry using the RTLS model. An empirical analysis of MODIS data suggests that the RTLS inversion remains robust when the relative change of geometry-normalized reflectance stays below 15%. This first of two papers introduces the algorithm, a second, companion paper illustrates its potential by analyzing MODIS data over a tropical rainforest and assessing errors and uncertainties of MAIAC compared to conventional MODIS products.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three decades of rapid economic development is causing severe and widespread PM2.5 (particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m) pollution in China. However, research on the health impacts of PM2.5 exposure has been hindered by limited historical PM2.5 concentration data.
OBJECTIVES: We estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from 2004 to 2013 in China at 0.1 degrees resolution using the most recent satellite data and evaluated model performance with available ground observations.
METHODS: We developed a two-stage spatial statistical model using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD) and assimilated meteorology, land use data, and PM2.5 concentrations from China's recently established ground monitoring network. An inverse variance weighting (IVW) approach was developed to combine MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue AOD to optimize data coverage. We evaluated model-predicted PM2.5 concentrations from 2004 to early 2014 using ground observations.
RESULTS: The overall model cross-validation R-2 and relative prediction error were 0.79 and 35.6%, respectively. Validation beyond the model year (2013) indicated that it accurately predicted PM2.5 concentrations with little bias at the monthly (R-2 = 0.73, regression slope = 0.91) and seasonal (R-2 = 0.79, regression slope = 0.92) levels. Seasonal variations revealed that winter was the most polluted season and that summer was the cleanest season. Analysis of predicted PM2.5 levels showed a mean annual increase of 1.97 mu g/m(3) between 2004 and 2007 and a decrease of 0.46 mu g/m(3) between 2008 and 2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Our satellite-driven model can provide reliable historical PM2.5 estimates in China at a resolution comparable to those used in epidemiologic studies on the health effects of long-term PM2.5 exposure in North America. This data source can potentially advance research on PM2.5 health effects in China.},

  abstract = {Satellite remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides an effective way to fill the spatial and temporal gaps left by ground PM2.5 monitoring network. Previous studies have established robust advanced statistical models to estimate PM2.5 using AOD data in China. However, their coarse resolutions (-10 km or greater) of PM2.5 estimations are not enough to support the health effect studies at urban scales. In this study, 3 lcm AOD data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 products were used to estimate the high resolution PM2.5 concentrations in Yangtze Delta Region of China. We proposed a nested linear mixed effects (LME) model' including nested month-, week, and day-specific random effects of PM2.5-AOD relationships. Validation results show that the LME model only with day-specific random effects (non-nested model) used in previous studies has poor performance in the days without PM2.5-AOD matchups (the R-2 of day-of-year-based cross validation (DOY-based CV) is 0.148). The results also show that our nested model cannot improve the performance of non nested model in the days with PM2.5-AOD matchups (sample-based CV R-2 = 0.671 for nested model vs. 0.661 for non -nested model), but can greatly improve the model performance beyond those days (DOY-based CV R-2 = 0.339 for nested model vs. 0.148 for non -nested model). To further improve the model performance, we applied the "buffer models" (i.e., models fitted from datasets which ground PM2.5 were matched with the average AOD values within certain radius buffer zones of gridded PM2.5 data) on the 3 km AOD data since the "buffer models" has more days with PM2.5-AOD matchups and can provide more day -specific relationships. The results of this study show that 3 km MODIS C6 AOD data can be used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations and can provide more detailed spatial information for urban scale studies. The application of our nested LME model can greatly improve the accuracy of 3 km PM2.5 predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown associations between chronic exposure to particulate air pollution and increased mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease, but fewer studies have examined the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution and specific cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). OBJECTIVE: We examined how long-term exposure to area particulate matter affects the onset of AMI, and we distinguished between area and local pollutants. METHODS: Building on the Worcester Heart Attack Study, an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in myocardial infarction incidence in greater Worcester, Massachusetts, we conducted a case-control study of 4,467 confirmed cases of AMI diagnosed between 1995 and 2003 and 9,072 matched controls selected from Massachusetts resident lists. We used a prediction model based on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements to generate both exposure to particulate matter </= 2.5 mum in diameter (PM2.5) at the area level (10 x 10 km) and the local level (100 m) based on local land use variables. We then examined the association between area and local particulate pollution and occurrence of AMI. RESULTS: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in area PM2.5 (0.59 mug/m3) was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 1.04, 1.29). An IQR increase in total PM2.5 (area + local, 1.05 mug/m3) was weakly associated with a 4% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 0.96, 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Residential exposure to PM2.5 may best be represented by a combination of area and local PM2.5, and it is important to consider spatial gradients within a single metropolitan area when examining the relationship between particulate matter exposure and cardiovascular events.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a cohort of older men living in the Boston Metropolitan area. METHODS: This longitudinal analysis included 669 participants from the Veterans Administration Normative Aging Study with up to four visits between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1,715 visits). Serum creatinine was measured at each visit, and eGFR was calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. One-year exposure to PM2.5 prior to each visit was assessed using a validated spatiotemporal model that utilized satellite remote-sensing aerosol optical depth data. eGFR was modeled in a time-varying linear mixed-effects regression model as a continuous function of 1-year PM2.5, adjusting for important covariates. RESULTS: One-year PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower eGFRs; a 2.1-mug/m3 interquartile range higher 1-year PM2.5 was associated with a 1.87 mL/min/1.73 m2 lower eGFR [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.99, -0.76]. A 2.1 mug/m3-higher 1-year PM2.5 was also associated with an additional annual decrease in eGFR of 0.60 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% CI: -0.79, -0.40). CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal sample of older men, the findings supported the hypothesis that long-term PM2.5 exposure negatively affects renal function and increases renal function decline.

  abstract = {We have used the MODIS satellite data and two global aerosol models to investigate the relationships between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud parameters that may be affected by the aerosol concentration. The relationships that are studied are mainly between AOD, on the one hand, and cloud cover, cloud liquid water path, and water vapour, on the other. Additionally, cloud droplet effective radius, cloud optical depth, cloud top pressure and aerosol Angstrom exponent, have been analysed in a few cases. In the MODIS data we found, as in earlier studies, an enhancement in the cloud cover with increasing AOD. We find it likely that most of the strong increase in cloud cover with AOD, at least for AOD < 0.2, is a result of aerosol-cloud interactions and a prolonged cloud lifetime. Large and mesoscale weather systems seem not to be a cause for the increase in cloud cover with AOD in this range. Sensitivity simulations show that when water uptake of the aerosols is not taken into account in the models the modelled cloud cover mostly decreases with AOD. Part of the relationship found in the MODIS data for AOD > 0.2 can be explained by larger water uptake close to the clouds since relative humidity is higher in regions with higher cloud cover. The efficiency of the hygroscopic growth depends on aerosol type, the hygroscopic nature of the aerosol, the relative humidity, and to some extent the cloud screening. By analysing the Angstrom exponent we find that the hygroscopic growth of the aerosol is not likely to be a main contributor to the cloud cover increase with AOD. Since the largest increase in cloud cover with AOD is for low AOD ( similar to 0.2) and thus also for low cloud cover, we argue that cloud contamination is not likely to play a large role. However, interpretation of the complex relationships between AOD and cloud parameters should be made with great care and further work is clearly needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent research highlights the promise of remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a proxy for ground-level particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM(2.5)). Particular interest lies in estimating spatial heterogeneity using AOD, with important application to estimating pollution exposure for public health purposes. Given the correlations reported between AOD and PM(2.5), it is tempting to interpret the spatial patterns in AOD as reflecting patterns in PM(2.5).
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the degree to which AOD can help predict long-term average PM(2.5) concentrations for use in chronic health studies.
METHODS: We calculated correlations of AOD and PM(2.5) at various temporal aggregations in the eastern United States in 2004 and used statistical models to assess the relationship between AOD and PM(2.5) and the potential for improving predictions Of PM(2.5) in a subregion, the mid-Atlantic.
RESULTS: We found only limited spatial associations of AOD from three satellite retrievals with daily and yearly PM(2.5). The statistical modeling shows that monthly average AOD poorly reflects spatial patterns in PM(2.5) because of systematic, spatially correlated discrepancies between AOD and PM(2.5). Furthermore, when we included AOD as a predictor of monthly PM(2.5) in a statistical prediction model, AOD provided little additional information in a model that already accounts for land use, emission sources, meteorology, and regional variability.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest caution in using spatial variation in currently available AOD to stand in for spatial variation in ground-level PM(2.5) in epidemiologic analyses and indicate that when PM(2.5) monitoring is available, careful statistical modeling outperforms the use of AOD.},

Based on the examples selected, PM10 levels (annual mean) ranged from 19 to 24 mug m(-3) at regional background sites, from 28 to 42 mug m(-3) at urban background, and from 37 to 53 mug m(-3) at kerbside sites. PM2.5 levels varied from 8 to 20 mug m(-3) at regional background sites, 20 to 30 mug m(-3) at urban background and 25 to 40 mug m(-3) at kerbside sites. The ratio PM2.5/PM10 is highly dependent on the type of site and varied widely between different EU regions. Source apportionment results showed that, on an annual average, the natural contribution (mineral and marine) at EU regional sites was in the range of 4-8 mug m(-3) in PM10 decreasing in PM2.5, but contributions up to 19 mug m(-3) were reported for specific locations. At urban sites, carbonaceous aerosols and secondary inorganic compounds accounted for a major fraction of PM10, and especially of the PM2.5 mass. Quantitative data on the contributions of the regional background, city background and local traffic to the mean annual levels of PM10, PM2.5 and major components were supplied. Climatic differences, long-range transport processes and winter traffic peculiarities (the latter in northern countries) contributed to the increase of PM10 and PM2.5 masses. At kerbside sites, an important dust contribution to PM2.5 is highlighted. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Emission estimates for ten metals classified as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) were refined using data from a recent HAP NEI. All emissions were spatially gridded, and U.S. emissions maps for dozens of trace elements (e.g., Fe, Ti) are presented for the first time. Nationally, the trace elements emitted in the highest quantities are silicon (3.8 x 10(5) ton/yr), aluminum (1.4 x 10(5) ton/yr), and calcium (1.3 x 10(5) ton/yr). Our chemical characterization of the PM2.5 inventory shows that most of the previously unspeciated emissions are comprised of crustal elements, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and metal-bound oxygen. This work also reveals that the largest PM2.5 sources lacking specific speciation data are off-road diesel-powered mobile equipment road construction dust marine vessels, gasoline-powered boats, and railroad locomotives,},

  abstract = {Accurate monitoring of the large-scale dimensions of global snow cover is essential for understanding details of climate dynamics and climate change. Presently, such information is gathered individually from ground station networks and satellite platforms. Efforts are in progress to consolidate and analyze long-term station records from a number of countries. To gain truly global coverage, however, satellite-based monitoring techniques must be employed. A 27-year record of Northern Hemisphere continental snow cover produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the longest such environmental record available. Records of Southern Hemisphere continental cover and snow on top of Arctic sea ice have been produced by similar means for a portion of this interval. The visible imagery charting technique used to generate these data provides information on snow extent but not on snow volume. Satellite microwave analyses over Northern Hemisphere lands show some promise in this regard, however, large-scale monitoring of snow extent with microwave data remains less accurate than visible charting.
This paper updates the status of global snow cover monitoring, concentrating on the weekly snow charts prepared by NOAA and discussing a new and consistent record of monthly snow cover generated from these weekly charts. The NOAA charts show a reduction of hemispheric snow cover over the past five years, particularly in spring. Snow areas from the NOAA product are then compared with values derived using passive microwave data. The latter consistently reports less snow cover than the more accurate visible product. Finally, future snow monitoring initiatives are recommended. These include continuing the consistent NOAA product until an all-weather all-surface product is developed. The latter would use multiple data sources and geographic information systems techniques. Such an integrative product would need extensive comparisons with the NOAA product to ensure the continued utility of the lengthy NOAA observations in studies of climate change. In a retrospective sense, satellite charts from the middle 1960s to early 1970s need reevaluation and techniques to merge satellite products with historic station time series must be developed.},

The validation results show that MODIS AODs from 10/3 km DT algorithm are comparable with those of the sun photometer, although there are slight overestimations. However, the DB algorithm substantially underestimates MODIS AODs when comparing with those of the sun photometer. Error analyses imply that the bias of surface reflectance estimation is the main error source for both algorithms. The cloud screening scheme of the DT algorithm is more effective than the DB algorithm. The cloud vicinity effect should be considered in the quality control processes for both of the algorithms. A sensitivity test suggests that in complex terrain area, like Chongqing, the collocation method in the validation of satellite products should be carefully selected according to local circumstances. When comparing the monthly mean AODs of MODIS products with sun photometer observations, it shows that the Terra MODIS AOD products are valid to represent the mean statuses in summer and autumn, but the monthly mean of Aqua MODIS AODs are limited in Chongqing.},

Under most conditions the PM2.5 concentrations and atmospheric stability increased with time during these events, so that the highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in long-lived CAPs. PM2.5 concentrations were generally observed to decrease with increasing elevation and were linearly related to the pre-sunrise valley heat deficit, an instantaneous measure of atmospheric stability. Decreases of up to 30 percent were observed as elevation increased from 1300 to 1600 m. During the CAP episode of 23-30 January, concentrations of PM2.5 increased roughly linearly with time at all elevations at the rate of about 6 mu g (m(3) day)(-1). Higher elevation sites also experienced more rapid influxes of clean air during the mix-out of a CAP on 16 January, although short-lived episodes of higher concentrations occurred at times when polluted air was carried upslope from the residual CAP that persisted at lower elevations.

The recent development of satellite-based remote-sensing models for air pollution enables the quantification of these risks and addresses many limitations of previous air pollution research strategies. We review the recent literature on the applications of satellite remote sensing in air quality research, with a focus on their use in epidemiological studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a focus of this review and a significant number of studies show that ground-level particulate matter can be estimated from columnar AOD. Satellite measurements have been found to be an important source of data for particulate matter model-based exposure estimates, and recently have been used in health studies to increase the spatial breadth and temporal resolution of these estimates. SUMMARY: It is suggested that satellite-based models improve our understanding of the spatial characteristics of air quality. Although the adoption of satellite-based measures of air quality in health studies is in its infancy, it is rapidly growing. Nevertheless, further investigation is still needed in order to have a better understanding of the AOD contribution to these prediction models in order to use them with higher accuracy in epidemiological studies.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were randomly selected from the San Antonio Heart Study population. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (aROC) curve derived from the Archimedes model was calculated and also compared with the aROCs from two published multiple logistic regression models designed to estimate diabetes risk. RESULTS: The aROC for the Archimedes model was 0.818 (95% CI 0.739-0.899) compared with aROCs of 0.869 (0.801-0.936) and 0.870 (0.802-0.937) for the two logistic regression models, respectively. Risk estimates from the logistic models were highly correlated with the estimates derived from the Archimedes model. CONCLUSIONS: The Archimedes model predicts individual diabetes risk with a high level of sensitivity and specificity, comparable with that of models designed specifically for that purpose. Unlike the latter models, Archimedes also predicts the risk of numerous other health outcomes.},

The participating models were the French CHIMERE model, the Dutch LOTOS-EUROS model, as well as the REM-CALGRID, the EURAD and the LM-MUSCAT models from Germany. In the selected 80-day period, observed PM10 daily mean concentrations reached values well above 50 mu g m(-3) on many days in large parts of Northern Germany. This model evaluation shows that there is an increasing underestimation of primary and secondary species with increasing observed PM10. The high PM levels were observed under stagnant weather conditions, which are difficult to simulate with either prognostic or diagnostic, interpolation-based meteorological models. Thus, it is quite likely that uncertainties in PM emissions and incomplete process sub-modules each separately account for only a portion of the underestimation of high PM. Uncertainties in key boundary layer parameters, which can differ by a factor of two or more between the models, represent an additional source of error-both as direct sources of error through the transporting meteorological fields and indirect sources of error through the physico-chemical modules which rely on key boundary layer parameters.

  journal  = {Bmc Bioinformatics},
  year     = {2007},
  volume   = {8},
  abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories.
Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand.
Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

Traditional methods to assess component-specific risks are limited, suggesting the need for alternative methods. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether the odds of daily hospital admissions differ by pollutant chemical properties. METHODS: We categorized pollutants by chemical properties and examined their impacts on the odds of daily hospital admissions among Medicare recipients > 64 years of age in counties in Atlanta, Georgia, for 1998-2006. We analyzed data in two stages. In the first stage we applied a case-crossover analysis to simultaneously estimate effects of 65 pollutants measured in the Aerosol Research and Inhalation Epidemiology Study on cause-specific hospital admissions, controlling for temperature and ozone. In the second stage, we regressed pollutant-specific slopes from the first stage on pollutant properties. We calculated uncertainty estimates using a bootstrap procedure. We repeated the two-stage analyses using coefficients from first-stage models that included single pollutants plus ozone and meteorological variables only. We based our primary analyses on exposures on day of admission. RESULTS: We found that 24-hr transition metals and alkanes were associated with increased odds [0.26%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02-0.48; and 0.37%; 95% CI, 0.04-0.72, respectively] of hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Transition metals were significantly associated with increased hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Increased respiratory-related hospital admissions were significantly associated with alkanes. Aromatics and microcrystalline oxides were significantly associated with decreased CVD- and respiratory-related hospital admissions. CONCLUSIONS: The two-stage approach showed transition metals to be consistently associated with increased odds of CVD-related hospital admissions.},

Satellite observations offer valuable global information about PM2.5 concentrations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed a technique for estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite observations. METHODS: We mapped global ground-level PM2.5 concentrations using total column aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MISR (Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite instruments and coincident aerosol vertical profiles from the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. RESULTS: We determined that global estimates of long-term average (1 January 2001 to 31 December 2006) PM2.5 concentrations at approximately 10 km x 10 km resolution indicate a global population-weighted geometric mean PM2.5 concentration of 20 microg/m3. The World Health Organization Air Quality PM2.5 Interim Target-1 (35 microg/m3 annual average) is exceeded over central and eastern Asia for 38% and for 50% of the population, respectively. Annual mean PM2.5 concentrations exceed 80 microg/m3 over eastern China. Our evaluation of the satellite-derived estimate with ground-based in situ measurements indicates significant spatial agreement with North American measurements (r = 0.77; slope = 1.07; n = 1057) and with noncoincident measurements elsewhere (r = 0.83; slope = 0.86; n = 244). The 1 SD of uncertainty in the satellite-derived PM2.5 is 25%, which is inferred from the AOD retrieval and from aerosol vertical profile errors and sampling. The global population-weighted mean uncertainty is 6.7 microg/m3. CONCLUSIONS: Satellite-derived total-column AOD, when combined with a chemical transport model, provides estimates of global long-term average PM2.5 concentrations.},

Evaluation of MODIS AOD with the Moscow AERONET site supports a MODIS-AOD error estimate of +/-(0.05 + 0.2 x AOD) for this event. However, since the smoke was often thick (AOD > 4.0) and spatially variable, the standard MODIS algorithm incorrectly identifies some aerosol as cloud. We test relaxed cloud screening criteria that increase MODIS coverage by 21% and find excellent agreement with coincident operational retrievals (r(2) = 0.994, slope = 1.01) with no evidence of false aerosol detection. We relate the resultant MODIS AOD to PM(2.5) using aerosol vertical profiles from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Our estimates are in good agreement with PM(2.5) values estimated from in-situ PM(10) (r(2) = 0.85, slope = 1.06), and we find that the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 is insensitive to uncertainties in biomass burning emissions. The satellite-derived and in-situ values both indicate that peak daily mean concentrations of approximately 600 mu g m(-3) occurred on August 7, 2010 in the Moscow region of the Russian Federation. We estimate that exposure to air pollution from the Moscow wildfires may have caused hundreds of excess deaths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results indicate that there is a good correlation between the satellite-derived AOT and PM2.5 (linear correlation coefficient, R = 0.7) indicating that most of the aerosols are in the well-mixed lower boundary layer during the satellite overpass times. There is excellent agreement between the monthly mean PM2.5 and MODIS AOT (R > 0.9), with maximum values during the summer months due to enhanced photolysis. The PM2.5 has a distinct diurnal signature with maxima in the early morning (6:00 similar to 8:00 AM) due to increased traffic flow and restricted mixing depths during these hours. Using simple empirical linear relationships derived between the MODIS AOT and 24hr mean PM2.5 we show that the MODIS AOT can be used quantitatively to estimate air quality categories as defined by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with an accuracy of more than 90% in cloud-free conditions. We discuss the factors that affect the correlation between satellite-derived AOT and PM2.5 mass, and emphasize that more research is needed before applying these methods and results over other areas.},

The cause of this subseasonal variation in the PM2.5 climatology is investigated through dynamical downscaling and large-scale diagnostics. Climatological analysis of the U.S. winter mean ridge reveals a mid-January subseasonal shift in the zonal direction, likely in response to variations in the Rossby wave source over the central North Pacific Ocean. This displacement of the winter mean ridge, in turn, has an impact on regional-scale atmospheric conditions-specifically, subsidence with local leeside enhancements and midlevel warming over Cache Valley. The analyses of this study indicate that the subseasonal peak of long-term mean PM2.5 concentrations in Cache Valley is linked to the large-scale circulations' subseasonal evolution, which involves remote forcing in the circumpolar circulations as well as possible tropical-midlatitude interactions. This subseasonal evolution of the winter mean circulation also affects precipitation along the West Coast.},

  abstract = {Critical meteorological factors affecting daily particulate concentrations during winter for Utah's urbanized Salt Lake Valley are examined on the basis of forty years of data. In a typical winter, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) is exceeded during 6 multi-day events comprising 18 winter days. Multi-day episodes of high stability produce these events, as synoptic-scale high-pressure ridges transit across Utah. The valley heat deficit, a bulk measure of atmospheric stability, exhibits large winter-to-winter variations that are highly related to similar variations in PM2.5. While control strategies have led to downward trends in concentrations for some primary pollutants, no long-term trends in valley heat deficit are evident over the 40 years. PM2.5 concentrations rise gradually over a period of days after a heat deficit threshold is exceeded as the air within the valley becomes decoupled from generally stronger winds aloft. Concentrations climb at a typical rate of about 10 mu g m(-3) d(-1) over a four-day period to about 60 mu g m(-3) during these episodes. During episodes when PM2.5 concentrations exceed 35 mu g m(-3), the atmospheric column in the valley is characterized by: temperature below 0 degrees C; relative humidity in excess of 50%; and light wind speeds. PM2.5 concentrations in excess of 35 mu g m(-3) are four times more likely when the valley is snow covered than when it is not. A stepwise multiple linear regression based upon selected meteorological variables is used to estimate daily values of PM2.5 during two independent winters. The correlation between observed and estimated PM2.5 for these winters reaches 0.81. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Persistent high aerosol loadings together with extremely high population densities have raised serious air quality and public health concerns in many urban centers in East Asia. However, ground-based air quality monitoring is relatively limited in this area. Recently, satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at high resolution has become a powerful tool to characterize aerosol patterns in space and time. Using ground AOD observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON)-Asia Campaign, as well as from handheld sunphotometers, we evaluated emerging aerosol products from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) aboard the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorology Satellite (COMS), and Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection 6) in East Asia in 2012 and 2013. In the case study in Beijing, when compared with AOD observations from handheld sunphotometers, 51% of VIIRS Environmental Data Record (EDR) AOD, 37% of GOCI AOD, 33% of VIIRS Intermediate Product (IP) AOD, 26% of Terra MODIS C6 3 km AOD, and 16% of Aqua MODIS C6 3 km AOD fell within the reference expected error (EE) envelope (+/- 0.05 +/- 0.15 AOD). Comparing against AERONET AOD over the Japan-South Korea region, 64% of EDR, 37% of IP, 61% of GOCI, 39% of Terra MODIS, and 56% of Aqua MODIS C6 3 km AOD fell within the EE. In general, satellite aerosol products performed better in tracking the day-to-day variability than tracking the spatial variability at high resolutions. The VIIRS EDR and GOCI products provided the most accurate AOD retrievals, while VIIRS IP and MODIS C6 3 km products had positive biases.},

  abstract = {Satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been used to assess population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The emerging high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), provides a valuable opportunity to characterize local-scale PM2.5 at 1-km resolution. However, non-random missing AOD due to cloud/snow cover or high surface reflectance makes this task challenging. Previous studies filled the data gap by spatially interpolating neighboring PM2.5 measurements or predictions. This strategy ignored the effect of cloud cover on aerosol loadings and has been shown to exhibit poor performance when monitoring stations are sparse or when there is seasonal large-scale missingness. Using the Yangtze River Delta of China as an example, we present a Multiple Imputation (MI) method that combines the MAIAC high-resolution satellite retrievals with chemical transport model (CTM) simulations to fill missing AOD. A two-stage statistical model driven by gap-filled AOD, meteorology and land use information was then fitted to estimate daily ground PM2.5 concentrations in 2013 and 2014 at 1 km resolution with complete coverage in space and time. The daily MI models have an average R-2 of 0.77, with an inter-quartile range of 0.71 to 0.82 across days. The overall model 10-fold cross-validation R-2 (root mean square error) were 0.81 (25 mu g/m(3)) and 0.73 (18 mu g/m(3)) for year 2013 and 2014, respectively. Predictions with only observational AOD or only imputed AOD showed similar accuracy. Comparing with previous gap-filling methods, our MI method presented in this study performed better with higher coverage, higher accuracy, and the ability to fill missing PM2 (5) predictions without ground PM2.5 measurements. This method can provide reliable PM2 (5) predictions with complete coverage that can reduce bias in exposure assessment in air pollution and health studies.},

  abstract = {The effect of air pollution on the changing pattern of glomerulopathy has not been studied. We estimated the profile of and temporal change in glomerular diseases in an 11-year renal biopsy series including 71,151 native biopsies at 938 hospitals spanning 282 cities in China from 2004 to 2014, and examined the association of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter of <2.5 mum (PM2.5) with glomerulopathy. After age and region standardization, we identified IgA nephropathy as the leading type of glomerulopathy, with a frequency of 28.1%, followed by membranous nephropathy (MN), with a frequency of 23.4%. Notably, the adjusted odds for MN increased 13% annually over the 11-year study period, whereas the proportions of other major glomerulopathies remained stable. During the study period, 3-year average PM2.5 exposure varied among the 282 cities, ranging from 6 to 114 mug/m(3) (mean, 52.6 mug/m(3)). Each 10 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 concentration associated with 14% higher odds for MN (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.18) in regions with PM2.5 concentration >70 mug/m(3) We also found that higher 3-year average air quality index was associated with increased risk of MN. In conclusion, in this large renal biopsy series, the frequency of MN increased over the study period, and long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of MN.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal characteristics of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particulate matter <2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) are increasingly being studied from satellite aerosol remote sensing data. However, cloud cover severely limits the coverage of satellite-driven PM2.5 models, and little research has been conducted on the association between cloud properties and PM2.5 levels. In this study, we analyzed the relationships between ground PM2.5 concentrations and two satellite-retrieved cloud parameters using data from the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) Network during 2000-2010. We found that both satellite-retrieved cloud fraction (CF) and cloud optical thickness (COT) are negatively associated with PM2.5 levels. PM2.5 speciation and meteorological analysis suggested that the main reason for these negative relationships might be the decreased secondary particle generation. Stratified analyses by season, land use type, and site location showed that seasonal impacts on this relationship are significant. These associations do not vary substantially between urban and rural sites or inland and coastal sites. The statistically significant negative associations of PM2.5 mass concentrations with CF and COT suggest that satellite-retrieved cloud parameters have the potential to serve as predictors to fill the data gap left by satellite aerosol optical depth in satellite-driven PM2.5 models.},

  abstract = {The 24-h PM2.5 samples (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less) were taken at 6-day intervals at five urban and rural sites simultaneously in Beijing, China for 1 month in each quarter of calendar year 2000. Samples at each site were combined into a monthly composite for the organic tracer analysis by GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Compared to the data obtained from other metropolitan cities in the US, the PM2.5 mass and fine 3 organic carbon (OC) concentrations in Beijing were much higher with an annual average of 101 and 20.9 mu g m(-3), respectively. Over one hundred organic compounds including unique tracers for important sources were quantified in PM2.5 in Beijing. Source apportionment of fine OC was conducted using chemical mass balance receptor model (CMB) in combination with particle-phase organic compounds as fitting tracers. Carbonaceous aerosols and major ions (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) constituted 69% of PM2.5 mass on average. The major sources of PM2.5 mass in Beijing averaged over five sites on an annual basis were determined as dust (20%), secondary sulfate (17%), secondary nitrate (10%). coal combustion (7%), diesel and gasoline exhaust (7%), secondary ammonium (6%), biomass aerosol (6%), cigarette smoke (1%), and vegetative detritus (1%). The lowest PM2.5 mass concentration was found in January (60.9 mu g m(-3)), but the contribution of carbonaceous aerosol to PM2.5 mass was maximal during this season, accounting for 57% of the mass. During cold heating season, the contributions from coal combustion and biomass aerosol to PM2.5 mass increased, accounting for 20.9% of fine particle mass in October and 24.5% in January. The contribution of the biomass aerosols peaked in the fall. In April 2000, the impact of dust storms was so significant that dust alone constituted 36% of PM2.5 mass. On average, the model resolved 88% of the sources of the PM2.5 mass concentrations in Beijing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurements of PM2.5 concentration over time and space are especially critical for reducing adverse health outcomes. However, sparsely stationary monitoring sites considerably hinder the ability to effectively characterize observed concentrations. Utilizing data on meteorological and land-related factors, this study introduces a radial basis function (RBF) neural network method for estimating PM2.5 concentrations based on sparse observed inputs. The state of Texas in the USA was selected as the study area. Performance of the RBF models was evaluated by statistic indices including mean square error, mean absolute error, mean relative deviation, and the correlation coefficient. Results show that the annual PM2.5 concentrations estimated by the RBF models with meteorological factors and/or land-related factors were markedly closer to the observed concentrations. RBF models with combined meteorological and land-related factors achieved best performance relative to ones with either type of these factors only. It can be concluded that meteorological factors and land-related factors are useful for articulating the variation of PM2.5 concentration in a given study area. With these covariate factors, the RBF neural network can effectively estimate PM2.5 concentrations with acceptable accuracy under the condition of sparse monitoring stations. The improved accuracy of air concentration estimation would greatly benefit epidemiological and environmental studies in characterizing local air pollution and in helping reduce population exposures for areas with limited availability of air quality data.},
